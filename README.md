DRESZCZ
Original author: Jacek Ciesielski
Adaptation developer: Filip Pawłowski (2023)

This project is an adaptation of the original 'DRESZCZ - GRA PARAGRAFOWA 1987' written in Python.

Description
This is my first extensive project and serves as an entry point for learning Python programming. The goal is to create an interactive version of the original game, which is heavily based on a paper book game created by Jacek Ciesielski, a Polish nonlinear writer, in 1987. The code is written in English, but the game itself is in Polish. An English translation may be available in the future.

Contributions are welcome!
